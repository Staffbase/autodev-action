# Example Usages

Always create the dev branch.

```yaml

  uses: Staffbase/autodev-action@v1.5.1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

Add a status comment if the merge was successful or failed.

```yaml

    token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

```

Add a status label if the merge was successful or failed.

```yaml

# Limitations

- currently only the first 100 pull requests are analyzed

# Release

You can create a new release by creating a new tag and bump the version in `package.json.`

# Development

Very nice that you want to work on the action. To create a working implementation, you can use the following command to perform all the necessary actions.

```bash
npm run all
```
